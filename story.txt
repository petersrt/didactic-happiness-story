The story begins! Rhett stood, readying himself for the battle of his life. A battle that would
assuredly decide the fate of all beings in the universe.
Story continues, and Mihir appears, summoned by Avigael of course.
Soon after Mihir appears, he summons Clare to the front.
This is Clare. 
Once upon a time, there was an amazing teacher who made everyone happy. Everyday, she would stand by the door and wish each of us a good day as we left. One time, she even chased a student down the hall that snuck past her.

This teacher also stood with her students ready to chase down the enemy with the skills she honed
daily in the hallways of school. 

The teacher along with her students fought valently to protect the universe from sure demise.
They shouted in unison the acient incantation learned from the old mystics "git add .!" "git commit -m"La Fin"!"
"git push!" The enemy in an instant was sucked away into space presumably banished to some mysterious realm
known only as "the interwebs"
